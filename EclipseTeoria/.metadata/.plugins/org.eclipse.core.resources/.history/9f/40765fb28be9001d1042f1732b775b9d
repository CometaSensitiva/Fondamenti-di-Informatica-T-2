/**
 * This class implements the geometric concept of a right isosceles triangle as
 * defined by the respective interface. Since multiple inheritance is not
 * supported between classes, one must choose whether to derive this class from
 * {@link ImplRightTriangle}, {@link ImplIsoscelesTriangle}, or - going one
 * level higher - directly from {@link ImplTriangle}. Usually, the choice is
 * made to reuse more code and rewrite less, and here the two choices are
 * essentially equivalent. Since {@link ImplRightTriangle} performs perhaps
 * slightly more complex operations while {@link ImplIsoscelesTriangle} only
 * renames some sides, we choose to derive from the former. The operations
 * defined by the latter must then be rewritten (code duplication).
