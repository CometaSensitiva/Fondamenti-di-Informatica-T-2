/**
 * The Contatore3 class provides a simple counter with instance methods for
 * managing its state. This implementation allows the counter to be reset and
 * incremented, and the current value to be retrieved. The counter state is
 * maintained as an instance variable, so each instance of the class has its own
 * counter. Two constructors are provided: one sets the counter to zero, and the
 * other sets the counter to a specific value.
 * 
 * Example usage: Contatore3 c1 = new Contatore3(); // creates a new counter
 * initialized to zero Contatore3 c2 = new Contatore3(5); // creates a new
 * counter initialized to 5
